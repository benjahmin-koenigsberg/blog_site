## Publisher's Summary

American health professionals are beginning to discover what their European counterparts have long understood: Many common chronic conditions - obesity, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, heart disease, and cancer, among others - often have their origins in the mouth.

In a groundbreaking new work, German dentist Dr. Dominik Nischwitz presents the principles of biological dentistry along with emerging scientific research on the mouth’s vital role in the body’s microbiome - a key to whole body wellness.

Challenging conventional dental wisdom that teeth are separate from the rest of the body and conventional dental practices that often cause more harm than good, It’s All in Your Mouth delivers:

* The latest research about the microbiome and the mouth
* Critical information on the dangers of root canals and amalgam fillings
* The important role of nutrition in oral health and hygiene
* A clarion call for a new approach to dentistry

Sensible, holistic, and humane, It’s All in Your Mouth presents a necessary new approach to natural immunity to chronic disease and the integrating dental hygiene with whole body wellness.
